So how do we check if a diet works and it's not broken, or how can we verify using a meter which leg

is which?

Let's say you are holding a diode in your hand.

I don't know which leg is the anad or the kettle.

Trust me, it happens quite often.

Well, a good way to verify the identity of the terminals is using an o meter to figure out the forward

current direction on the resistance.

Setting the meter puts a smaller voltage on it test leads, which is why an o meter needs a battery

and you use that small voltage to see which way current flows.

So the diode is flipped in each image.

If the o meter reads a finite resistance, that means the diode is conducting a small current in the

forward direction and the red probe of the meter is touching the anode.

If the meter reads or L, which comes from out of limits.

The diode is not conducting Corren, which means that the red probe is touching the cathode.

Now your meter might also have a diode setting, a little diode symbol.

If it does, it will display the forward voltage when the red probe is touching the anode.

So if you have a diode setting, the meter will display.

Well, a typical reading is between about zero point two and zero point six or zero point seven.

If you see some voltage appearing on the display of the meter, it means that the red probe is touching

the anode and the black probe is touching the cathode.

If you flip the two probes, the meter will show or well, again.
