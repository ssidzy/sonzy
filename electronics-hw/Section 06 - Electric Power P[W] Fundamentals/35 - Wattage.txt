In the previous course I mentioned that electric power is measured by combining both how much electric

energy is transferred and how fast that transfer happens.

So energy is measured in terms of joules, and since power is a measure of energy over a set amount

of time, we can measure it in joules per second.

The international system of units for joules per second is the watt abbreviated as W, and it's very

common to see what preceded by one of the standard prefixes like Microwatts, Milliwatt kilowatt, megawatt

and gigawatts are all common depending on the situation.

Microcontrollers like the Arduino will usually operate in the microwatt or milliwatt range.

Laptop and desktop computers operate in the standard watt power range.

Energy consumption of a house is usually in the kilowatt range.

Large stadiums might operate at the megawatt scale and gigawatts come into play for large scale power

stations and of course, time machines.
