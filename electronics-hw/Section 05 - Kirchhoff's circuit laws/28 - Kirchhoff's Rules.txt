There are two important rules that you must absolutely know about when it comes to analyzing simple

or complex air grids.

The first one is called kickoffs current law, or some people like to call it the junk shot rule.

And it states that the total current or charge entering a junction or node is exactly equal to the charge,

leaving the node as it has no other place to go except leave or no charge is lost within the node.

In other words, the algebraic sum of all the currents entering and leaving a node must be equal to

zero.

If you have basic math knowledge, you know that the symbol is called sigma and it's generally used

to denote a sum of multiple elements.

All right.

So the currents entering a node must be equal to the currents exiting a node.

And this is what we call kickoffs first law or more intuitively, kickoffs, current law.

The second kickoffs law, also known as kickoffs, what its law states that in any closed loop network,

the total voltage around the loop is equal to the sum of all the voltage drops within the same loop,

which is also equal to zero.

In other words, the algebraic sum of all the voltages within the loop must be equal to zero.

And this idea by kickoff is known as the conservation of energy.

I will now provide explanations of these two rules, followed by problem solving, hints for applying

them and worked examples that use them.
