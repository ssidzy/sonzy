We'll come back, so PNB transistor has the same names as the poppy base EDM, and to write a poppy

transistor will turn on whether you have a small current running from ATM to base of the transistor.

And when I say turn on, I mean that the transistor will open up a channel between ammeter and Connecter,

and this channel can carry a much larger current OK, to get current running from ammeter to base,

you need a voltage difference of about zero point zero words.

Since the chloro goes from ammeter to base, the base needs to be zero point seven was lower than Daym.

So by setting the base voltage of a petrolist or two zero point seven was lower than Daym, you turn

the transistor on and allow for corale to flow from ammeter to collector.

And now let's take an example.

So to turn this ALYDA on, you need to turn on the transistor so that the channeler from ammeter to

collector opens.

To turn on the transistor.

You need to get the voltage on the base to be zero point seven watts lower than Daym, which is nine

watts, minus zero point seven watts, which is equal to eight point three words.

So as long as the base of the pipe is lower with zero point seven volts that daym the transistor will

conduct current.

But why exactly is 0.01?

Watts has dropped from Daym to the base.

If you look at the super simplified model of a transistor, you will see two diodes pointing towards

the base where there is voltage applied to the meter.

There will be a dial drop of zero point seven volts, right?

So the base will be zero point seven volts lower the daym, hence the transistor will turn on again.

This representation is not quite accurate because if you apply voltage at the collector, these diode

will not conduct Corot and the transistor won't turn on.

But it's true that if you apply a voltage at the base, current will not flow from base to collector

or from base daym.
