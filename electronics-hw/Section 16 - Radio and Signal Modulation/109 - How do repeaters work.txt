All right, guys.

It's a continuation of the previous course, I want to show you something about repeaters.

I don't know whether you have used or heard about Walkie-Talkie.

I hope I pronouncing it correctly, which is nothing else but the head held portable radio that uses

radio waves to communicate wirelessly on a single frequency band.

Now, as long as the other person holding a walkie talkie is in a straight line from the initial user

who's holding a walkie-talkie as well, both can communicate without a problem.

This is a radio to radio connection, and it's called simplex communication.

A walkie talkie works fine if there is no obstruction between the radio that is calling and the radio

that is receiving.

But what happens if there is a heel or a big building in the way line of sight is no longer possible

because something is blocking the radio?

Often in these situations, a radio that can repeat the message is placed on the top of the mountain

called a repeater or base station.

If a user wants to make a call on the handheld radio, the message goes in a straight line up to the

repeater.

So what happens is that the repeater needs to receive the frequency that the caller transmitted before,

and then the repeater transmits the same message down to the user on the other side of the mountain.

It works similarly to the satellite and its cost, with very high frequency radio propagation.

But instead of a satellite, it is a fixed radio on top of the hill.
