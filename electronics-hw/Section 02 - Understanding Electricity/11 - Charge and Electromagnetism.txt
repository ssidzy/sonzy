Two of the three particles that make up atoms, electrons and protons have a very interesting characteristic

called electric charge.

Charge can be one of two polarities: negative or positive.

Electrons have a negative polarity, while protons have a positive polarity.

Now, the most important thing to know about charge is that opposite charges attract and similar charges

repel.

Negative attracts positive and positive attracts negative, but negative repels negative and positive repels positive.

:)

As a result, electrons and protons are attracted to each other, but electrons repel other

electrons, and protons repel other protons.

The attraction between protons and electrons is what holds the electrons and the protons of an atom

together.

This attraction causes the electrons to stay in their orbits around the protons in the nucleus.

So here are a few enlightening details about charge.

You see, "charge" is a property of one of the fundamental forces of nature known as electromagnetism.

As I said in the previous course, an atom normally has the same number of electrons as protons.

This is because the electromagnetic force causes each proton to attract exactly one electron.
