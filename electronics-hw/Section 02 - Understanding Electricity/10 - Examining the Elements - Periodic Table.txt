Several times in this chapter, I use the term "element" without explaining it.

So here's the deal. An element is a specific type of atom defined by the number of protons in its nucleus.

:)

For example, hydrogen atoms have just one proton in the nucleus.

An atom with two protons in the nucleus is helium.

Atoms with three protons are called lithium and so on.

The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called the atomic number.

As a result, the atomic number of hydrogen is one.

The atomic number of helium is two, lithium is three and so on.

Copper, an element that plays an important role in electronics, is atomic number 29.

And as a result, it has 29 protons in its nucleus.

All right.

But what about neutrons?

The other particle found in the nucleus of an atom?

You see, neutrons are extremely important to chemists and physicists, but they don't really play that

big of a role in the way electric current works.

So we can safely ignore them in this chapter.

Suffice it to say that in addition to protons, the nucleus of each atom except hydrogen contains neutrons,

and in most cases, there are few more neutrons than protons.

So the third particle that makes up atoms is the electron.

You see, electrons are what we are most interested in when we work with electricity because they are

the source of electric current.

They are unbelievably small.

A single electron is about 200.000 times smaller than a proton.

So what you have to remember right now is that atoms usually have the same number of electrons as protons.

And as a result, an atom of an element

Copper has 29 protons in the nucleus that is orbited by 29 electrons.

When an atom picks up an extra electron or finds itself short of an electron,

things get interesting because of a special property of protons and electrons called charge, which

I will explain in the next course.
