Some elements don't hold on to their outermost electrons very tightly.

These elements frequently lose electrons or pick up extra electrons.

And so they frequently get bumped off of neutral and become either negatively or positively charged.

Such elements are called conductors.

And the best conductors are the metal-silver, copper, and aluminum.

Other elements hold on to their electrons very tightly. In these elements,

it's hard to lose an electron or force another electron in. These elements almost always stay neutral,

and they are called insulators. In a conductor,

electrons are constantly skipping around between nearby atoms.

An electron jumps out of one atom.

Call it Atom A into a nearby atom, which I will call Atom B.

But almost immediately, an electron will jump out of another nearby atom.

Call it Atom C into Atom A.

This skipping around of electrons in a conductor happens constantly.

Atoms are in perpetual turmoil, giving and receiving electrons and constantly cycling

their net charges from positive to neutral to negative and back to positive.

Ordinarily, this movement of electrons is completely random.

One electron might jump left, but another one jumps right.

One goes up.

Another goes down.

One goes east.

The other goes west.

The net effect is that although all the electrons are moving, collectively, they aren't going anywhere.

They are like keystone cops running around aimlessly in every direction, bumping into each other,

falling down, picking themselves back up, and then running around some more.

When this randomness stops and the keystone cops get organized, the result is electric current, as

I will explain in the next course.
