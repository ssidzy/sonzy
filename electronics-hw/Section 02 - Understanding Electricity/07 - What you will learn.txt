All right, guys.

In this chapter, basically, we will learn about four important things.

First, we will be unraveling the deep mysteries of the matter and energy.

Well, only a little bit after that, we will be learning about three important aspects of electric circuits,

which are current, voltage and power.

After that, we will be looking at the difference between direct and alternating current.

And finally, you will be learning your first electrical equation.

Don't worry.

It's very simple.

Now, frankly speaking, the title of this chapter is a bit ambitious.

Before you can do much, that's very interesting,

with electronics,

you need to have a basic understanding of what electricity is and how it works.

But unfortunately, understanding electricity is a little bit difficult.

But don't let this discourage you.

Even the smartest physicists in the world don't really understand it. Now, at the start of this chapter,

we will be examining the very nature of electricity, what it is and what causes it?

The first part of this chapter will remind you of a 7th or 8th-grade science class, as you delve

into the insides of atoms and learn about protons, neutrons and electrons.

The second part of this chapter introduces you to three things you have to know about electricity,

if you want to design and build circuits. These are namely called current, voltage, and power.
