So what can we use something amplifiers for either inverting or an unyielding that if the input resistance's

of an amplifier are connected to potential meters, for example, the individual input signals can be

mixed together by varying amounts, for example, measuring temperature.

You could add a negative offset voltage to make the output voltage or display read zero at the freezing

point, or produce an audio mixer for adding or mixing together individual waveforms which are sounds

from different source channels like Walker's instruments, etc., before sending them combined to an

audio amplifier.

Another useful application of a summing amplifier is a weighted some digital to analog converter if

the input resistors are in of the something amplifier double in value for each input.

So for example, one km km, four km, eight km, 16 kms, etc. then a digital logic voltage, either

a logic level zero or a logic level one on these inputs will produce an output which is the weighted

some of the digital inputs.

Of course, this is a simple example in this digital to analog converter something amplifier Sevket.

The number of individual bits that make up the input data world and it is example for bits, will ultimately

determine the output step voltage as a percentage of the fullscale analog output voltage.

And also the accuracy of these foskett output depends on what these levels of the input bits being consistently

zero four zero consistently firewall's for one, as well as the accuracy of the resistance values used

for the input resistors.

Fortunately, to overcome these errors, at least on our part, commercially available digital to analog

and analog to digital devices are readily available with highly accurate resistor letter networks already

built in.
