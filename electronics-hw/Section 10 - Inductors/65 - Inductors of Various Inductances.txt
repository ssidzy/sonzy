Welcome back.

Here are again, three circuits which are identical except for the size of the inductor in them.

So this time the frequency is the same for all of the three circuits, only the size of the inductor

changes.

What I want to show you here is that the size of the doctor has an effect on the overall current flow.

Alagiri doctor, as you can see, has more opposition to changes in Canada and the inductor on the top

is the largest.

So the current flow is smallest in that circuit.

But why is that?

If you forgot, the endarterectomy is equal to two P times F times inductance, so the returns not only

varies with the applied signal frequency, but also with the size of the inductor.

And it's quite obvious from this formula that the larger the inductance, the larger the I mean, the

higher the inductive reactants in the Third Circuit, the maximum current is the highest compared to

the other two.

And that's because the returns of the inductor is the smallest.

So the main takeaway from this simulation is that the source is constantly trying to change the current

and the large inductor is best at opposing those changes.
