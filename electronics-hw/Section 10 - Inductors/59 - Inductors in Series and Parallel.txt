Inductors connected these series and parallel behaved the exact opposite way to capacitors, for example,

to calculate the inductance of a group of inductor the series, you can simply sum up the values of

the individual inductance is where L is the total inductance and L1 L2 and are the individual instances.

So suppose you have to inductors one measuring Tamiko Henry and the other 15 microarray.

Then by putting them in a series you obtain a total inductance of 25 microarray inductors in parallel

behave the same way as resistors.

In parallel, the inductance is given by the following formula where L is the total inductance and L1

L2.

And are the individual instances in this way, if you connect to 10 microarray doctors in parallel,

for example, you will end up with an inductance of five microarray.
