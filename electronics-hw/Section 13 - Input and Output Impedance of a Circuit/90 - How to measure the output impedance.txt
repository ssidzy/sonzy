All right.

So how can we measure the output impedance of a circuit?

Well, the measurement of output impedance uses the same method earth for input impedance, but with

different connections.

In this case, the amplifier load is replaced with a variable resistor, care must be taken, however,

to assure that the resistance connected in place of the load is able to dissipate sufficient power without

damage.

The amplifier need not be run at full power for this test.

So, first of all, connect the test circuit as shown in this figure.

And initially, the output from the amplifier should be adjusted for a display similar to that used

for the input impedance test.

But this time with no load connected to the output terminals.

The test resistance is connected across the output terminals and adjusted for maximum resistance before

switching on the amplifier.

The first resistance uses reduced in value until the display indicates half the amplitude of that noted

with no load.

But this resistance is now the same value as the output impedance.
